--------------------- Database License ----------------------------

Please note, the above license is for the source code only.
This project DOES NOT include a license to the IP 
resolution database. We do NOT distribute the data with this 
project. Instead, updatedb will pull several data-files from
different 3rd parties. Special license terms to these data-files
DO apply. Please check the 3rd parties websites for the exact
terms and to find out, whether or not you're allowed to use
the data files for your purpose. You may need to apply for neccessary
licenses on your own. 

The main data is MaxMind's (http://www.maxmind.com) GeoLite database
that may be used for free for some purposes under the condition,
that you attribute the origin (at least, at present, Nov 2014). 
See http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/ for the details.
